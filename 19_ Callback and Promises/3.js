// 3. Age in Days
// Write a function that takes in an array of integers and a callback function, and returns a new array where each 
// Write a JavaScript function called ageInDays that accepts an object containing a person's first name, last 
// name, and age in years as input. The function should concatenate the first and last name into a single string 
// and store it in a variable called fullName. It should then calculate the person's age in days and store it in a 
// variable called ageInDays.


// The ageInDays function should then return a callback function that logs a message to the console. The 
// message should include the person's full name and age in days, and should be in the format: "The person's full 
// name is [full name] and their age in days is [age in days]."


// Note that the ageInDays function should not log the message to the console directly, but should instead return 
// a callback function that can be used to log the message at a later time.
